# Consumer Credit Risk Modeling

This repository contains code and resources for analyzing a portfolio of consumer mortgages, building predictive models for probability of default (PD), constructing scorecards, and performing risk analytics aligned with regulatory requirements (such as Basel regulations).

## Project Overview

The workflow in this project covers:

1. **Data Analysis**: Exploration and cleaning of consumer mortgage portfolio data.
2. **Probability of Default Modeling**: Building statistical and/or machine learning models to predict the likelihood of default for each loan.
3. **Scorecard Development**: Translating model outputs into a practical credit scorecard for risk segmentation.
4. **Cutoff Optimization**: Determining the optimal score threshold for lending decisions.
5. **Loan Binning & Monitoring**: Grouping loans by score, and tracking default rates across bins over time.
6. **Economic Factor Analysis**: Studying how observed default rates relate to macroeconomic variables.
7. **Provisioning & Regulatory Compliance**: Calculating provisions needed by the bank to meet Basel regulatory standards.

## Features

- End-to-end workflow for credit risk modeling using consumer mortgage data.
- Tools for scorecard creation and cutoff optimization.
- Analysis modules for linking credit performance to economic factors.
- Guidance for regulatory provisioning (Basel compliance).
